### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

Focused more on user experience, such as scroll view and click to browse larger picture and load more on demand. 
Those are important as by the end of the day, user won't be using the App if it's not user friendly.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

2 Hours. The first thing I done is trying to figure out a way to fetch data which takes about 30 min, and after finished doing that, the rest of the time is just about formatting the UI to achieve user friendly interfaces and testing

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

Not really, the only thing I would say is I was initally trying to do a infinite scroll view which replaces the "Next" Button.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

Again will have to be the infinite scroll view. The approach that I tried was working on my own project but somehow not working here.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.

Not really
